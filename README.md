FSAUtils
========

Models of finite automata (DFA, NFA) with support of common operations and easily readable creation of objects.

The main goals of this project are:

* Support of easily readable definitions of finite automata (FA) and regular expressions
* Support of important basic operations on FA
* Adherence to the following coding guidelines aiming to assure correctness:
    * Simple and easily understandable code
    * Mostly adherence to the functional programming paradigm
    * Functional parts of the code (the core) closely follows abstract mathematical definitions of the respective operations

Features supported so far
-------------------------

* Creation of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
* Creation of Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
* Determinization of NFA
* Creation of Regular Expressions (RE)
* Checking for acceptance of a word by an automaton
* Concatenation, Star, Union, Intersection, Complement for DFA/NFA
* Checking DFA/NFA for equivalence
* Implicit conversion of DFA to NFA
* Pretty-printing toString methods for DFA/NFA
* Determination of the language (RE) of a DFA/NFA
* Conversion of RE to NFA (i.e. also checking of equivalence of DFA/NFA with RE)
* Minimization of DFA
* (De-)Serialization to and from XML

Get Started (1.1 Beta Version)
------------------------------

**Prerequisites:** You need to have Scala and the JVM installed. FSAUtils
has been tested with Scala 2.11.2 and Java 1.7. Furthermore, the environment
variable `$SCALA_HOME` has to be correctly set to the path where Scala resides.

The following steps should work for a Linux system.

1. Download the archive:
   
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/rindPHI/FSAUtils/archive/v1.1-beta.tar.gz -O FSAUtils-1.1-beta.tar.gz
   ```
   
2. Extract it:
   
   ```bash
   tar xzf FSAUtils-1.1-beta.tar.gz
   ```
   
2. Build it:
   
   ```bash
   cd FSAUtils-1.1-beta/
   ant
   ```
   
   As the result, you find a file "FSAUtils.jar" in the directory `lib/`
   which you need to add to the classpath of scalac and scala in order
   to compile / run your objects that make use of FSAUtils.
   
3. In your Scala files, add the import

   ```scala
   import de.dominicscheurer.fsautils._
   ```
   
   and, if you want to use the FSA domain specific language
   for better readability, let your object extend `FSA_DSL`:
   
   ```scala
   object MyObject extends FSA_DSL {
   ```
   
4. Compile your scala object:
   
   ```bash
   scalac -classpath "/path/to/FSAUtils.jar" YourObject.scala
   ```
   
5. ...and run it:
   
   ```bash
   scala -classpath ".:/path/to/FSAUtils.jar" YourObject
   ```
   
An example file like mentioned in points 3. to 5. could have, for instance,
the following content:

```scala
import de.dominicscheurer.fsautils._

object FSAUtilsTest extends FSA_DSL {
  
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val myDFA =
            dfa ('Z, 'S, 'q0, 'd, 'A) where
                'Z  ==> Set('a, 'b)   and
                'S  ==> Set(0, 1)     and
                'q0 ==> 0             and
                'A  ==> Set(0)        and
                'd  ==> Delta(
                      (0, 'a) -> 0,
                      (0, 'b) -> 1,
                      (1, 'a) -> 0,
                      (1, 'b) -> 1
                )|
        
        print("DFA accepts aaab: ")
        println(myDFA accepts "aaab")
        print("DFA accepts aaaba: ")
        println(myDFA accepts "aaaba")
    }
    
}
```

If you wish to run the included unit tests, execute

```bash
ant runTests
```

in the `FSAUtils-1.1-beta` directory.

Examples
--------

Please consider the file Test.scala to see some working applied examples.

### Creation of a DFA

```scala
val myDFA =
    dfa ('Z, 'S, 'q0, 'd, 'A) where
	    'Z  ==> Set('a, 'b)   and
	    'S  ==> Set(0, 1)     and
	    'q0 ==> 0             and
	    'A  ==> Set(0)        and
	    'd  ==> Delta(
              (0, 'a) -> 0,
              (0, 'b) -> 1,
              (1, 'a) -> 0,
              (1, 'b) -> 1
        )|

print("DFA accepts aaab: ")
println(myDFA accepts "aaab")
```

### Creation of an NFA

```scala
val myNFA =
    nfa ('Z, 'S, 'q0, 'd, 'A) where
        'Z  ==> Set('a, 'b)   and
        'S  ==> Set(0, 1)     and
        'q0 ==> 0             and
        'A  ==> Set(1)        and
        'd  ==> Delta(
              (0, 'a) -> Set(0, 1),
              (0, 'b) -> Set(0)
        )||

print("NFA accepts aaab: ")
println(myNFA accepts "aaab")
```

### Star Operation for NFA

```scala
println((myNFA*) accepts "aaabaaab")
```

### Determinization for NFA

```scala
println((myNFA toDFA) accepts "aaab")
```

### Complement for DFA

```scala
println((!myDFA) accepts "aaab")
```

### Concatenation

```scala
println(myNFA ++ myNFA2);
```

### Pretty Printing

`println(myNFA toDFA)` yields:

```
DFA (Z,S,q0,d,A) with
|    Z = {a,b}
|    S = {{},{0},{1},{0,1}}
|    q0 = {0}
|    A = {{1},{0,1}}
|    d = {
|        ({},a) => {},
|        ({},b) => {},
|        ({0},a) => {0,1},
|        ({0},b) => {0},
|        ({1},a) => {},
|        ({1},b) => {},
|        ({0,1},a) => {0,1},
|        ({0,1},b) => {0}
|    }
```

### Creation of RE

```scala
def myRegExp = (('a*) + ('b & ('b*) & 'a))* : RE
```
